  - Each crewmate has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant crewmate

    - Users can navigate to to the edit form from the detail page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attribute value options
  - e.g., a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their crewmate before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes
- [ ] A section of the summary page, displays summary statistics about a user’s crew on their crew page
  - e.g., the percent of members with a certain attribute 
- [ ] The summary page displays a custom “success” metric about a user’s crew which changes the look of the crewmate list
  - e.g., a pirate crew’s predicted success at commandeering a new galley


The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Add sprites to each team member based on species
* [x] Add description to detail page based on species
