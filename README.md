## üìñ Project Background

This project was originally developed as part of my web development coursework and later enhanced to highlight **real-world full-stack development practices**.  

### Challenges Solved
- Implemented **create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)** operations with persistent storage in Supabase.  
- Designed a clean, minimal UI for browsing and editing Pok√©mon teams.  
- Integrated with the **Pok√©API** to provide dynamic sprites and descriptions.  
- Connected frontend and backend seamlessly to handle both **real-time updates** and **data persistence**.

## üìà Future Improvements
- Add categories (e.g., Trainer Class or Role) to restrict attribute options.  
- Display team statistics such as type distributions or success metrics.  
- Enhance visuals with team-based performance indicators and custom styling.  
- Build user authentication with Supabase to allow personal, persistent Pok√©mon teams.
